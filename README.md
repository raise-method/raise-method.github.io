# The RAISE Specification Language and Method

RAISE (“Rigorous Approach to Industrial Software Engineering”) is a product consisting of a formal specification language (RSL), an associated method for software development and supporting tools.

RAISE was originally developed during the years 1985-1995 in the CEC-funded projects RAISE (ESPRIT 315) and LaCoS (ESPRIT 5383). The founder of these projects was Dines Bjørner. The original RAISE tool set can be requested from Jan Storbank Pedersen at Terma A/S.

Later extensions to the language and a new tool set, rsltc, were developed during the years 1998-2008 at the United Nations University UNU-IIST under the lead of Chris George. At the Technical University of Denmark further extensions to the language and the rsltc tools have been conducted under the lead of Anne Haxthausen. rsltc and some of its extensions, as well as some examples, can be found at [GitHub](https://github.com/raisetools?tab=repositories).
